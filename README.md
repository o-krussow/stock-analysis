# stock-analysis

Just testing out a simple strategy and trying to find the best "parameters" for it.

Actual code is cpp/analyze-stock.cpp

It was going to take FOREVER to run with only one thread, so I put together a very crude multithreading implementation.

One day it might be cool to revisit this and rewrite it to run on an MPI cluster
